    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In the spare time remaining from university, I worked in various fields such as waitressing, carpentry, and retail sales consultancy, but mostly in sales consultancy for about a year and a half. However, my main job or primary occupation is in civil aviation. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a job in this field, and in the back of my mind, I always had an interest in software development. So, I gradually started taking steps towards becoming a software developer.
